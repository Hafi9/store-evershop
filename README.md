EverShop â€“ An Open-Source Node Ecommerce Platform Introduction
Welcome to the EverShop. A Node Ecommerce Platform!

EverShop is an open-source Node ecommerce platform that helps developers developing their e-commerce store. EverShop is a flexible platform built on a module system, with extensible options for both the admin panel and the front store.

Technology stack
EverShop's highly modular structure is a result of several open source technologies embedded into a stack. These open source technologies are composed of the following components:

NodeJS
Node.js is an open-source server side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It provides an event driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side application using JavaScript.

PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness. EverShop requires PostgreSQL 13 or higher.

React
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. EverShop implements server-side rendering of React components with hydration to provide a fast, performant experience and SEO optimization.

GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. EverShop uses GraphQL and React to build a flexible and extensible front-end.
